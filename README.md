# Predictive Modeling for Medical Treatment Outcomes

I led a team of four in a comprehensive predictive modeling project focused on medical treatment outcomes. Our objective was to leverage advanced machine learning techniques, including Boosted Trees (BT), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Trees (DT), on a diverse "Medical Treatment Dataset" containing various medical parameters.

This project demonstrated my leadership in orchestrating a team effort towards developing robust predictive models with actionable insights for medical treatment outcomes. We emphasized continuous improvement through rigorous evaluation, feature engineering, and collaborative problem-solving.
