# Predictive Modeling for Medical Treatment Outcomes

I led a team of four in a comprehensive predictive modeling project focused on medical treatment outcomes. Our objective was to leverage advanced machine learning techniques, including Boosted Trees (BT), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Trees (DT), on a diverse "Medical Treatment Dataset" containing various medical parameters.

This project used a dataset to study mental health factors related to work environments. By analyzing data like age, gender, location, and work-related details, the project aimed to predict if individuals needed mental health treatment. Machine learning models like Decision Trees and Neural Networks were used to make these predictions, with Gradient Boosting performing the best. Key findings highlighted which factors, such as work interference, were important in determining treatment needs.
